# 0x04. C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This repository contains solutions for tasks that focus on using functions and nested loops in C programming.

## Tasks

### Task 0: 98 Battery st.

Write a function `reset_to_98` that takes a pointer to an integer and updates the value it points to to 98.

### Task 1: Don't swap horses in crossing a stream

Implement the function `swap_int` that swaps the values of two integers.

### Task 2: This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read

Create a function `_strlen` that returns the length of a string.

### Task 3: I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them

Develop a function `_puts` that prints a string, followed by a new line, to the standard output.

### Task 4: I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear

Write a function `print_rev` that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.

### Task 5: A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes

Design a function `rev_string` that reverses a string.

### Task 6: Half the lies they tell about me aren't true

Implement a function `puts2` that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### Task 7: Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half

Create a function `puts_half` that prints the second half of a string, or the last n characters if the number of characters is odd.

### Task 8: Arrays are not pointers

Develop a function `print_array` that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### Task 9: strcpy

Write a function `_strcpy` that copies a string to a buffer.

### Task 10: Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers

Develop a function `_atoi` that converts a string to an integer.

### Task 11: Don't hate the hacker, hate the code

Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program "101-crackme".

Each task includes a specific programming challenge to be solved using functions, strings, and arrays in the C programming language.
