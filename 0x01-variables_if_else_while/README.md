# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains C programs created as part of the 0x01 project, focusing on variables, if-else statements, loops, and basic C programming concepts.

## Project Tasks

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
    - This program assigns a random number to a variable and prints if the number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **The last digit**
    - Generates a random number and prints its last digit along with specified conditions.

3. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
    - Prints the alphabet in lowercase using only the `putchar` function.

4. **alphABET**
    - Prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase using the `putchar` function.

5. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
    - Prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding 'q' and 'e', using only the `putchar` function.

6. **Numbers**
    - Prints single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 using the `putchar` function.

7. **Numberz**
    - Prints single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 using `putchar` without using a variable of type `char`.

8. **Smile in the mirror**
    - Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using only the `putchar` function.

9. **Hexadecimal**
    - Prints numbers in base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase using the `putchar` function.

10. **Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
    - Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers in ascending order using only `putchar`.

11. **Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
    - Prints all possible combinations of two different digits in ascending order.

12. **Software is eating the World**
    - Prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers in ascending order.

## File Structure

The C files for each task can be found in the '0x01-variables_if_else_while' directory of the 'alx-low_level_programming' repository.
