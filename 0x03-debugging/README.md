# 0x03. C - Debugging

This repository contains debugging tasks in C to identify and rectify issues in provided code.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Multiple Mains

The task involves creating a file named `0-main.c` to test the `positive_or_negative()` function, taking a case of 0 as input. The function is to be tested with the given `main.c` file. Note that the task is to test the function, not implement it. Only changes to one line are allowed.

### Task 2: Like, Comment, Subscribe

The provided `1-main.c` file contains a segment leading to an infinite loop. The challenge is to comment out the problematic code without altering the line count. The objective is to resolve the issue and ensure the program executes without an infinite loop.

### Task 3: 0 > 972?

The program in `2-main.c` is intended to determine the largest number among three integers. However, the current code in `2-largest_number.c` fails to correctly identify the largest number. The task is to fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` to accurately determine the largest of the three integers.

### Task 4: Leap Year

The `3-main_a.c` program converts a date to the day of the year, considering leap years. However, the `3-print_remaining_days()` function does not correctly handle leap years, leading to inaccurate output. The task involves fixing the `print_remaining_days()` function to accurately determine the day of the year and the remaining days, accounting for leap years.

These tasks aim to challenge debugging skills by identifying and fixing issues in the provided code while following the specified constraints.
